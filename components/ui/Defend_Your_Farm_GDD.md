Game Overview
"Defend Your Farm" is a casual defense game inspired by "Defend Your Castle," reimagined in a charming farm setting. As a farmer, your task is to protect your crops from waves of pests and animals determined to eat or destroy them. The game combines hands-on action—swatting enemies directly—with strategic placement of farm-themed defenses like scarecrows and dogs. Alongside defense, you’ll manage resources by planting, harvesting, and selling crops to earn money for upgrades, creating a blend of fast-paced action and light strategy.
Gameplay Mechanics
Waves of Enemies
Enemies attack in waves, with each wave increasing in intensity by introducing more pests or new enemy types.

Waves are organized as "days" or "seasons," with a fixed number of waves per level.

Direct Action
Players click or tap on enemies to "swat" them away, echoing the interactive enemy-throwing mechanic from "Defend Your Castle."

This direct method serves as the immediate, hands-on defense option.

Defenses
Players can deploy farm-themed defenses to automatically combat enemies:
Scarecrows: Deter birds within a set radius.

Dogs: Chase away small animals like rabbits.

Traps: Capture or eliminate specific pests.

Fences: Block or slow down larger animals.

Crops and Resources
Plant, grow, and harvest crops such as carrots, corn, and pumpkins to generate income.

Successfully defended crops can be harvested for full value; damaged crops yield reduced or no resources.

Sell harvested crops to earn in-game currency.

Upgrades
Use money from crop sales to enhance gameplay:
Upgrade defenses (e.g., stronger scarecrows, faster dogs).

Purchase better tools (e.g., increased swatting speed).

Expand the farm (e.g., add new fields or diversify crops).

Enemy Types
Enemies are farm-themed pests and animals, each with distinct behaviors:
Rabbits: Fast but fragile; they target root crops like carrots.

Birds: Airborne enemies that peck at seeds and young plants.

Deer: Tougher foes that trample fields and consume multiple crops.

Boars: Highly durable; they destroy structures and eat crops indiscriminately.

Defense Types
Strategically place these farm-inspired defenses to protect your farm:
Scarecrows: Effective against birds; upgradable to expand their deterrence range.

Dogs: Pursue rabbits and small pests; trainable for improved speed or strength.

Traps: Designed for specific enemies (e.g., rabbit snares, bird nets).

Fences: Safeguard areas or slow down larger animals like deer and boars.

Progression
Levels: Each level represents a "day" or "season," requiring survival through a set number of waves.

Difficulty: Waves escalate in challenge with more enemies, faster attacks, or new enemy types.

Upgrades: After completing a level, use earned currency to improve defenses and farm capabilities.

Art Style
Visuals: Cartoonish and colorful, capturing a cheerful rural farm atmosphere.

Design: Features cute crops and animals (e.g., hopping rabbits, swooping birds) alongside chaotic enemy waves for dynamic contrast.

Setting: Comprises fields, barns, farmhouses, and details like hay bales and tractors.

Sound Design
Background: Farm ambiance with chirping birds, rustling leaves, and distant animal sounds.

Enemies: Unique audio cues for each enemy type (e.g., rabbit squeaks, bird caws, boar grunts).

Actions: Satisfying "thwack" sounds when swatting enemies, plus distinct audio for harvesting and upgrading.

Monetization
In-App Purchases: Offer special defenses, cosmetic farm items (e.g., fancy scarecrow hats), or Farm Coins.

Currency: The game uses Farm Coins, earned through gameplay or available via purchase.

Token Swap: Players lacking Farm Coins can exchange other tokens (e.g., Noot token) for Farm Coins in the game’s swap section.

Narrative
Story: Minimal focus on narrative to emphasize gameplay. Optionally, include a light premise about saving the family farm from ruin caused by rampant pests.

Core Gameplay Loop
Prepare: Plant crops and position defenses before a wave begins.

Defend: Swat enemies manually while defenses operate during waves.

Harvest: Collect surviving crops once a wave ends.

Sell & Upgrade: Use proceeds from crop sales to buy upgrades or expand the farm.

Repeat: Tackle the next wave with enhanced strategies and defenses.

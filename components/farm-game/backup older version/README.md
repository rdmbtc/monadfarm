### Available Defenses

   - Longer range (200 pixels)
   - Slower attack speed (2 seconds)
   - Deals 1 damage per attack

2. **Dog (30 coins)**
   - Effective against rabbits
   - Medium range (150 pixels)
   - Faster attack speed (1.5 seconds)
   - Deals 2 damage per attack
   - Visual: Brown rectangle with a dog emoji üêï

### How to Place Defenses

1. Click on one of the defense buttons in the top-right corner of the game
2. Move your cursor to the right side of the screen (defenses can only be placed on the right side)
3. A blue placement indicator will show where the defense will be placed
4. Click to place the defense if you have enough coins
5. To cancel placement mode, click the selected defense button again

### Defense Placement Rules

- Defenses can only be placed on the right side of the screen
- Each defense costs coins to place (Scarecrow: 20, Dog: 30)
- You cannot place defenses on top of each other
- The placement indicator will show:
  - Blue if placement is valid and you have enough coins
  - Yellow if placement is valid but you don't have enough coins
  - Red if placement is invalid (wrong side of screen or already occupied)

### How Defenses Work

- Defenses automatically attack enemies that enter their range
- Each defense can only target specific enemy types:
  - Scarecrows can only target birds
  - Dogs can only target rabbits
- After attacking, defenses have a cooldown period before they can attack again
- Defenses will show a visual attack animation when they target an enemy

### Advanced Defense Strategy

1. Place scarecrows on the right side to catch birds early
2. Place dogs near the middle-right to catch rabbits that get through
3. Focus your manual clicking on enemies that your defenses can't target
4. Balance your spending between planting crops (left side) and placing defenses (right side)

### Resetting the Game

When you reset the game using the "Reset Game" button:

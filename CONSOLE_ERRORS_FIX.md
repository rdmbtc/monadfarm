# Console Errors Fix Guide

This guide addresses the common console errors you may encounter after deployment and provides solutions.

## ‚úÖ Fixed Issues

### 1. Missing Asset Error (nooter.png) - RESOLVED
**Error**: `nooter.png:1 Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404`

**Solution**: Created the missing `nooter.png` file in `/public/images/` directory.

### 2. Duplicate WalletConnect Initialization - RESOLVED
**Error**: "WalletConnect Core is already initialized"

**Solution**: Modified providers to only initialize ReactTogether on client-side, preventing duplicate initialization during SSR.

### 3. Coinbase Smart Wallet Chain Support - RESOLVED
**Error**: "The configured chains are not supported by Coinbase Smart Wallet: 10143"

# Wave Progression Fix

## Bug Description
There's an issue in the game where waves don't start properly after defeating all enemies. This happens because there are multiple delays in the wave progression logic that sometimes cause the next wave to not trigger correctly.

## Fix Details
The fix in `wave-progression-fix.js` addresses this by:

1. Removing the delays in the wave completion check in `update()` method
2. Removing the 500ms delay in `forceNextWave()` method
3. Enabling `autoWave=true` by default in `startGame()` method
4. Removing the emergency recovery delay in the error handler
5. Making the safety check in `update()` run on every frame instead of occasionally

## How to Apply the Fix

You can apply the changes manually by following the instructions in the `wave-progression-fix.js` file. Each section includes:
- The original code to find
- The replacement code to use

Look for these specific areas in the GameScene.js file:
1. Wave completion check in the `update()` method (around line 2560)
2. Delay in `forceNextWave()` method (around line 1860)
3. Game state setup in `startGame()` method (around line 1410)
4. Emergency recovery in `forceNextWave()` error handler
5. Safety check in the `update()` method

After applying these changes, waves should progress automatically and without delays after all enemies are defeated.

## Testing the Fix
After applying the fix, test the game by:
1. Starting a new game
2. Defeating all enemies in a wave
3. Confirming that the next wave starts immediately
